To add a new page:
1) Add a xx.md in _pages (e.g. start from projects.md from the al-folio github)
2) To specify page layout (the template from _layout -- webpage layout lib), title, permalink etc.
3) To specify the corresponding control vars in _config.yml
4) To define a html template for each item (e.g., member.html in _includes -- webpage component lib) to be used by the xx.md
5) To add new content, each item may be defined in a specific format (e.g., member.html in _includes) with the content from a separate file (e.g. in phd_swapnil.md in _team)
