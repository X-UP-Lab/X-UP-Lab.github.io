Xiatian Zhu, a Senior Lecturer affiliated with the [Surrey Institute for People-Centred Artificial Intelligence](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence) and the [Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP)](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing) at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/) in Guildford, UK, leads the Universal Perception (UP) Lab. Previously a research scientist at Samsung AI Centre, Cambridge, UK, Dr. Zhu holds a Ph.D. from the [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/).

The UP Lab is dedicated to advancing <b> Multimodal Generative AI (GenAI)</b> by modelling diverse data and observations, such as images, videos, audio, text, 3D points, LiDAR, radar, and remote sensing etc. Our applications span a wide range of domains, such as creative media, fashion design, healthcare, climate science, finance, cybersecurity, chemical engineering, sports, gaming, and social issues. Guided by our principle of putting people at the heart of AI, we prioritize the ethical integration of AI capacities with real-world application norms, emphasizing sustainable and responsible AI practices. This ensures our AI initiatives are grounded in community needs and values, aiming to develop transformative technologies that positively impact society and enhance the well-being of individuals and communities.
