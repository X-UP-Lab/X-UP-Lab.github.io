Xiatian Zhu, a Senior Lecturer affiliated with the [Surrey Institute for People-Centred Artificial Intelligence](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence) and the [Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP)](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing) at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/) in Guildford, UK, leads the Universal Perception (UP) Lab. Previously a research scientist at Samsung AI Centre, Cambridge, UK, Dr. Zhu holds a Ph.D. from the [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/).

The UP Lab is dedicated to advancing AI capabilities by modelling diverse perception data, such as images, videos, audio, text, 3D points, LiDAR, and remote sensing. Application domains span computer vision, healthcare, weather and climate, finance, cybersecurity, and social issues. Our work emphasizes the intersection of machine learning theories and real-world domain applications, aiming to develop transformative technologies for societal benefit.
